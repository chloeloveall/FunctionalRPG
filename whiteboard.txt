1)main screen with buttons for classes
2)user clicks class button and it sets the storeState's initialState argument to that class's initialState
3)there are buttons that button to increase or decrease HP, buttons to increase or decrease experience points
4) set thresholds for if HP hits 0 character dies or if experience points hit a certain number, character levels up
5)leveling up will increase player's stats in a certain way
6) set up monster class similar to player 
7) introduce maybe turn based system where player can click buttons to do damage to monster until monster hp hits zero, then player experience points increment
8) add items to increase hitpoints or improve stats
